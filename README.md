Yet another LZMA Python wrapper
===============================

This time with support for LZMA_SYNC_FLUSH :tada:

Works directly with liblzma.so via [ctypes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html).
No other dependencies.


But why? Python standard library already contains lzma moduleâ€¦
--------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, but it does not support the SYNC FLUSH operation.

There is [`LZMACompressor.flush()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/lzma.html#lzma.LZMACompressor.flush)
but it does something different - it
[finishes the compression process](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/0353b4eaaf451ad463ce7eb3074f6b62d332f401/Modules/_lzmamodule.c#L568)
and closes the compressor.
It is not possible to compress more data after `flush()`.

For some of my use cases I need to use "sync flush". The constant `LZMA_SYNC_FLUSH`
[does not even appear in the CPython source code](https://github.com/python/cpython/search?q=LZMA_SYNC_FLUSH&unscoped_q=LZMA_SYNC_FLUSH).


What is LZMA_SYNC_FLUSH?
------------------------

From `lzma/base.h` (by Lasse Collin, public domain):

```c
        LZMA_SYNC_FLUSH = 1,
                /**<
                 * \brief       Make all the input available at output
                 *
                 * Normally the encoder introduces some latency.
                 * LZMA_SYNC_FLUSH forces all the buffered data to be
                 * available at output without resetting the internal
                 * state of the encoder. This way it is possible to use
                 * compressed stream for example for communication over
                 * network.
                 *
                 * Only some filters support LZMA_SYNC_FLUSH. Trying to use
                 * LZMA_SYNC_FLUSH with filters that don't support it will
                 * make lzma_code() return LZMA_OPTIONS_ERROR. For example,
                 * LZMA1 doesn't support LZMA_SYNC_FLUSH but LZMA2 does.
                 *
                 * Using LZMA_SYNC_FLUSH very often can dramatically reduce
                 * the compression ratio. With some filters (for example,
                 * LZMA2), fine-tuning the compression options may help
                 * mitigate this problem significantly (for example,
                 * match finder with LZMA2).
                 *
                 * Decoders don't support LZMA_SYNC_FLUSH.

Usage
-----

```python
from yalzma import LZMAEncoder
import lzma

text = b'Hello, World!'
enc = LZMAEncoder()
xz_data = enc.run(text)
xz_data += enc.finish()
assert lzma.decompress(xz_data) == text
```

Demonstration of the flush functionality:

```python
from io import BytesIO

enc = LZMAEncoder()
xz_data = enc.run(b'first line\n')
xz_data += enc.sync_flush()
assert lzma.open(BytesIO(xz_data), mode='rb').readline() == b'first line\n'

xz_data += enc.run(b'second line\n')
xz_data += enc.finish()
assert lzma.decompress(xz_data) == b'first line\nsecond line\n'
```
